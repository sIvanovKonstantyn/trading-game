Let's implement new features:
Besides that price graph, let's show:
rsi grash, bollinger bands and volumes

Also let's add some tex area, where we will show the news text.
For now let's just populate the news by random text.

Let's add "cancel" button to the open oders table.

When we load initial data on the application bootstrap, it seems like it stucks. Let's add some loading page with "Loading..." text and random funny texts that appread on the loading sceeen.

let's make bollinger chart a bit light color and price chart a bit more solid so it's simpler to see the main price chart

To the initial screen, where we setup the initial balance, let's also add the fee values (default is 0.0001). Let's apply this fee to each transaction so our trading will be more realistic.

Let's make RSI and volumes charts more sold and in the same color theme as price chart to have the consistent UI.

Let's replace "cancel" text of the order canceling buttong to "x" so it will take less space.

On the finish screen, where we show the results, let's add the "New game" button. When we press on this buttong, the game should be relauched from the beginning (endr player name, balance, etc.)

Now, let's implements the real "News" logic. Given: we need to have "OPEN_API_KEY" env. variable. If we don't have it - out news text area shows: "Not awailable. Specify the OPEN_API_KEY to have this feature".
If OPEN_API_KEY is specified, for each "next day" click (and on the opening for the first day as well) we call OpenAI chat API with the following prompt:
"Make the news analyze that affect the cryptomarket and show the result with dates in the table view. Date: {currentDate}.
{currentDate} - the the current date of the game (each "next day" clisk increases it).


Let's make few imrovements:
1. Let's add ability to specify sum in usdc, which we want to buy/sell. The amount of btc will be recalcualted according to the price and usdc sum.
