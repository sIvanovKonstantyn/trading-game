Let's implement new features:
Besides that price graph, let's show:
rsi grash, bollinger bands and volumes

Let's add "cancel" button to the open oders table.

When we load initial data on the application bootstrap, it seems like it stucks. Let's add some loading page with "Loading..." text and random funny texts that appread on the loading sceeen.

let's make bollinger chart a bit light color and price chart a bit more solid so it's simpler to see the main price chart

To the initial screen, where we setup the initial balance, let's also add the fee values (default is 0.0001). Let's apply this fee to each transaction so our trading will be more realistic.

Let's make RSI and volumes charts more sold and in the same color theme as price chart to have the consistent UI.

Let's replace "cancel" text of the order canceling buttong to "x" so it will take less space.

On the finish screen, where we show the results, let's add the "New game" button. When we press on this buttong, the game should be relauched from the beginning (endr player name, balance, etc.)


Let's make few imrovements:
1. Let's add ability to specify sum in usdc, which we want to buy/sell. The amount of btc will be recalcualted according to the price and usdc sum.


Let's add the leaderboard. When we finish the game, it's results (player name, initial balance, final balance, pnl) should be saved in "leaderboard.txt" file and all the file content should be parsend and shown in a scrolled table.
The table should be ordered by PnL desc.

Let's create the "Open deals" tab beside the "Open orders". There, we want to store the "buy orders" and be able to manuaaly mark the deal as "completed" and place the sum.
In the summary report we should see all the PnLs of each deal.

- Add file-based cache for Binance API price data. Store previously loaded data in cache/SYMBOL/YYYY-MM-DD.json and load from cache before making network requests.

- Add UI controls above the chart to select which technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, RSI, Volume) to display. Indicators should be shown or hidden based on user selection, following best practices from leading crypto exchange platforms.
